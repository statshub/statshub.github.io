              <p>One of the essential statistical considerations for the any research studies or dissertation proposal is sample size justification. Your committee wants to know that your sample size is adequate to address your research questions. The way to justify a sample size is with a statistical power analysis. </p>

              <p>One of the essential statistical considerations for your dissertation methods section is a statistical power analysis to justify your sample size. When you hire me to help with your Dissertation Proposal, I will advise/tutor you on the concepts and perform the appropriate power analysis for your study.</p>
              <p>Basically, a Power Analysis is a statistical procedure that determines whether your proposed sample size is large enough to provide statistically significant power (e.g. 80%) to detect a "meaningful effect size". </p>
